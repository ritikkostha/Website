                    long as we are not asked to define it. This is normal: there is
                    no consensus definition of it, and the term is rejected by most
                    academic disciplines in both the sciences and the humanities.
                    Yet it stays, and even better: it is eminently political – and
                    even more so at a time when the idea of “protecting nature” is
                    pressing. In this article, we attempt to unravel its mysteries,
                    tracing its origin, its evolution and the succession of issues
                    in which it has found itself in a central position. The aim is
                    to identify the different realities it embraces, and the
                    particular ways in which we relate to them in the era of global
                    crises.Thus, “nature” remained essentially a “casual” term in European languages, and has almost never been the subject of advanced academic theorization, except for the expression “human nature”, which had its moment of glory in the 18th century under the impetus of David Hume or Jean-Jacques Rousseau [1] (Figure 2).
                    Yet the ecological crisis has brought the idea of nature back to the forefront, and the word is now everywhere: this fact shows that it may not mean “nothing”, and that it is not really substitutable either. At a time when nature is said to be “in crisis”, when everyone would like to “protect” or even “act” on it, it is more imperative than ever to have a clear idea of this concept and its ramifications, which is what this article proposes to do [2].

                Nature is a common notion, which everyone is familiar with as
